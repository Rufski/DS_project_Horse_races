# DS_project_Horse_races
Machine learning project where I intend to collect and analysis data from horse races in France over the period 2004-2019.

Prospects of the project include:
- web scraping / data cleaning
- clustering analysis to estimate if there are special categories of races / horses
- logistic regression using machine learning methods / deep learning methods to predict the results of a given race.
