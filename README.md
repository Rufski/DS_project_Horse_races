# DS_project_Horse_races

## In a nutshell
This repository hosts a data science project for which I intend to collect and analyze data from horse races in France over the period 2004-2019.

Prospects of the project include:
- web scraping / data cleaning
- clustering analysis to estimate if there are special categories of races / horses
- logistic regression using machine learning methods / deep learning methods to predict the results of a given race.

This project is to be updated weekly.
